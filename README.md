# About This Site:

This is my first trial on making a website

## Used Tags and Syntaxes

Tags and syntaxes that I've been using when creating a simple website are:

```html
<doctype! html>
<html>
  <head></head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title></title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <header></header>
    <main></main>
    <footer></footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

## About me:  
I am Muhammad Restu Utomo. Currently I'm starting to learn about web development at HACKTIV8. As I have no experience in coding/programming, I still have a lot to catch-up to become a web developer.
